            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>and our light ſhineth to the glorie and praiſe of God. But the name of a Miniſter is yet of more regarde, by whoſe ſtanding and falling many are drawne, and the reproach of ſuch men reacheth nerest to the heauens, and God is moſt diſhonoured by their diſhonour: for he hath ſaid,</hi> I vvill be ſanctified in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that come neere me:<note place="margin">Leuit. 10.3.</note>

Notwithſtanding when a brother ſhall reproach his brother,<note place="margin">Chriſtians to reproach one the other, hurtful to the Church.</note> and one Christian ill an other, and the houſe of God ſhall be deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: then is it moſt dangerous. For there will the enemie of mankinde, cast in many bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning fire brandes and heape on much drye wood, that we might be all conſumed one of another. And ſuch (my moſt reuerend and beloued brethren) hath beene our caſe and condition:<note place="margin">The ſtate of manie godlie Miniſters</note> becauſe we haue deſired &amp; ſought after the good proceeding and perfection of our Church, in the ſeruice and worſhip of Chriſt, and withholden our hands from doe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and allowing of ſome thinges, in our iudgement, hurtfull to the ſame, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariant

To haue beene called pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſian, Puritane hoatheaded, proud, conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, ſchiſmatickes and troublers of the Church, wee haue borne it patientlie (God knowing our innocencie) and could yet be are it more; ſo as by our ſuffring of contempt, the Church of England, might receaue honour, and Gods people reioyce vnder good guiding paſtoures.

And we cannot now heale this ſoare by any priuate doing; for it is ſpread abroad ſo vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall, and mens mindes are ſo vniuerſallie poſſeſſed therewith, that we haue no way to doe good but to come into the open theater of

Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in doubtles I haue cauſe to ſuſpect myne owne inſufficiencie.

How be it I craue the patience and charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble taking of this my writing of them both; and I hope they will accept my good will. For in an eſpeciall loue toward both parties I haue taken this in hand: and haue ſet God before mine eies before them both, that ſo neere as I coulde and as far as I knowe and am able, I vtter that which is right in his ſight, not ſeeking to pleaſe ame man of either ſide: but endeuouring to doe a worke pleaſing to God, and good for his Church, I might mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter occaſion of profit to them both.

But about the tenth year of her Maieſties raigne, the Papiſts as men which began to ſhake of the feare, wherewith the mightie God, protecting &amp; bleſsing her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſties moſt godlie and Chriſtian pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, had ſtrocken them, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtes (I ſay) began to come foorth of their dennes, and as it is well knowne to the ſtate, practiſed diuers treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous attemptes; but amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g other, they
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:1452:15"/>preferred ſuch greeuous accuſations againſte the godlie and faithfull Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters; that then and from thence forth, they were left naked, &amp; a great ſtorme fell vpon them; and ſo it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued now and then ſharper, &amp; ſome time their was a calme, &amp; men brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed &amp; returned to the Lords worke. About anno 1571.<note place="margin">Subſcription came foorth firſt Anno 1571.</note> (as I take it) Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription was firſt enforced vpon the miniſtrie, for which cauſe in that time certaine men wrote and admonition to the parlament, opening diuers things worthie reformatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Wherupon aroſe greate volumes of prouing, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending, which are famouſlie knowne to all men, that vnderſtand of theſe cauſe. But how fleſh and blood did in theſe writings ouer-ſway the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian moderation and mildnes, which brethren ſhuld haue ben verie careful of, in contending for trueth, by the hote purſuite of either ſide, I reioyce not to rehearſe, and I am ſorie as ofte as I thinke vppon the lamentable ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectes &amp; hurte of the Church in thoſe times: How be it, our mercifull God, whoſe vnchaungeable loue, doeth ſwallow vp manye of our infirmities
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:1452:15"/>and follies, graunted vnto vs in the midſt of theſe fierie contentions, a goodlie ſpace of quietneſſe about the time that the reuerend father Maiſter <hi>Grindall</hi> was Archbiſhoppe of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turburie. In which time in al the ſouth partes of Englande, there was greate concorde among the Miniſters, and they ioyned in great loue and ioy one with another in the Lords worke. So that in the ſpace of 4. or 5. yeares (as I remember) there were infinit ſoules brought to the knowledge of Chriſt: &amp; the people reioyſed for the conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, ſeing &amp; beholding how greatly they were bound to praiſe God, for her Maieſties moſt chriſtian gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, vnder whoſe moſte godly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, they had ſucked and taſted the ſweet and vndeceaueble milke of Gods trueth, euen the holye faith of Gods elect, the doctrine of ſaluation. It was a golde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> time, full of godly fruit, great honour to the Ghoſpell, greate loue and kinde fellowſhip among all the Miniſters, preaching the faith, &amp; the people vnited in the true feare of God and cheerefull reuerence to her Maieſtie. But this life not affoording
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:1452:16"/>conſtant proſperitie to heauenly loue and growth of godlines.</p>
            <p>After the ſaid Archbiſhops deceaſe, there came foorth a newe and freſh aſſault of ſubſcription, vniuerſallie impoſed,<note place="margin">Anno Dom. 1584. the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full year of ſubſcription.</note> and againe enforced vppon all the Miniſters in three articles.</p>
            <p>Firſt of the Queenes Maieſties So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne authoritie ouer all perſons, &amp;c. Seconde, that the booke of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon prayer and of or dayninge Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoppes, Prieſtes and Deacons, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine in it nothing contrarie to the woorde of God, &amp;c. Thirde, to allowe and approue all the articles of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion agreed vpon by the Archbiſhops and Biſhops, &amp;c. 1562. and to beleeue all therein contayned to bee agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to God. When in the viſitations and publike meetinges the Miniſters were called to ſubſcribe: they offered very freely and willingly to ſubſcribe the firſt article of her Maieſties moſt lawfull authoritie. And for the other two they refuſed to doe anye further, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by law they were bound, &amp; name lie according to the ſtatute made for that purpoſe anno 13. Herevpon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:1452:16"/>in diuers Shires were ſuſpended from the execution of their Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and ſome depriued. And great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſion aroſe in the Church, the one ſuing for reformation and to be eaſed of ſuch burdens, and the other vrging verie ſtraightly the former things, &amp; puniſhing ſuch as woulde not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable. Then came there forth a newe cloude of writing and mennes affections waxing vvhote &amp; drawing to the worſe, it was a verye common name to all theſe Miniſters to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Puritanes: As men which made conſcience of many things, which the reuerend Fathers, and many learned men affirmed to be lawfull.</p>
            <p>In all this time there was much preaching in the Vniuerſities, aboute nonreſidents and vnpreaching mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters: and there ſhould you ſee a plain diuiſion, one ſorte called youths, and the other ſorte which tooke not ſuch libertie, were called Preciſians. And this is growne both in the Vniuerſitie &amp; in the countrie town and citie, that who ſo feareth an oth, or is an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry reſorter to ſermons, earneſt againſt exceſſe, ryot, poperie, or any diſorder,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:1452:17"/>they are called in the vniuerſitie pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſians, and in other places Puritans.</p>
            <p n="4">4 And thus as faithfully as I can, I haue ſhewed how this name came vp, and whereupon honeſt &amp; godly men haue beene and ar called puritans or preciſians: here it foloweth to bee conſidered out theſe thinges, what is their offence, and the ſtate of their cauſe:<note place="margin">For fower thinges men are called pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritanes.</note> which may be referred to foure heads: 1 ſcruple in the vſe of certaine ceremonies: 2 ſcruple in ſubſcribing beyond the ſtate: 3 ſeeking for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of ſome ceremonies and of ſome parte of the eccleſiaſticall diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline. 4 the people do heare ſermons, talke of the Scriptures, ſinge Pſalmes together in priuate houſes, &amp;c.

            <p>The next thing we ſeeme to falt in is the refuſall to ſubſcribe abſolutely,<note place="margin">Of ſubſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> to the two laſt articles.

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:1452:21"/>vnleſſe I open ſomewhat more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, what theſe two articles containe. The firſt of the tvvo, which is the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond of the ſubſcription, comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the vvhole booke of common prayer and of ordering of Biſhops, Prieſts, and Deacons, ſo that we muſt by our hand writing auoutch that euerie rubrick, clauſe &amp; ſentence in theſe bookes are wholie and perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly agreeing to holie Scripture, and in no one rubrick or clauſe contrarie to the ſame: and ſecondlie to promiſe to vſe the forme &amp; none other. Then in the third article, we are bound to approue, all the articles made by the Biſhoppes in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uocation holden Anno 1562. which containe not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie matters of doctrine, but alſo of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and diſcipline, wherein there be 22 homilies appointed to bee red in the Church, that by our hande wee ſhould acknowledge, that theſe and euerie of theſe be agreeable to God.<note place="margin">How farre the godlie Miniſters are confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable.</note> The difference betweene the reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Fathers and vs heerein is this: Firſt that we doe willinglie vſe the booke of common prayer and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther forme, vnleſſe ſometime vpon

Secondly we profeſſe our ſelues to enioy our miniſtrie by no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther order, but by order of that book, which is the booke of ordering Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, &amp;c. Thirdlie we ſubſcribe wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linglie to the book of Articles accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſtatute 13 in that behalfe prouided: namelie to thoſe Articles which onlie concerne the confeſſion of the true faith &amp; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> doctrine of ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, as that ſtatute expreſly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth and limiteth. Now finding (in examining of theſe bookes) ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things doubtfull in our conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, we dare not promiſe or ſubſcribe further the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> according to theſe words. And therefore for this cauſe wee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited an humble petition to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerend aſſembly of the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uocation, holden Anno 1585. with our reaſons why we refuſed to ſubſcribe, in ſuch ample maner as they required.</p>
            <p>This beeing that which wee haue done and ſtood in: it remaineth to be examined, whether heerein we haue

Wee
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:1452:25"/>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore think that in ſubſcribing heare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto, we ſhould offend the holie Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non of Scripture, &amp; allow that which is contrarie to the ſame, by our ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription.

            <p>Now our third fault is, that we did ſeeke by ſupplicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to the reuerend aſſemblie of the conuocation houſe,<note place="margin">Of ſuiug for reformation.</note> by petition of the Lords of her Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties moſt honourable priuie counſel and to the high Court of Parliament:

So great hurt is it, when an honeſt &amp; lawfull courſe is begun, for fooliſh &amp; hairbraine men to thruſt in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues &amp; to hazard ſuch meanes as God ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſanctified. For God needeth not our follie:<note place="margin">1. Cro. 15.13.</note> but will make a breach a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong vs if we ſeeke him not in order.

For by this meanes, we finding the mighty winds and ſtronge ſtreame againſt vs, were faine to humble our ſelues vnder Gods mercie, and commending our ſelues &amp; our cauſe to him, who iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth righteouſly: we reſerued ourſelues to a better time, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it ſhould pleaſe his gracious wiſedome, to make his owne trueth to appeare, and to moue the mindes of our ſuperiours to bee more fauourable.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Then tooke the idle and vnprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching Miniſters comfort at the heart, ſuppoſing their ſtanding to be good: &amp; the non-reſidents had their mou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes enlarged: it became daungerous both in the Vniverſitie and countrie to reproue either of theſe, &amp; the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were become conuenticlers, if they met together to ſing a Pſalme, or to talk of Gods word.

There are manie prettie and wittie thinges, which are founde in the ſtuddie of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane learning: &amp; in theſe men of great learning, haue manie times delight: ſo that when they are in writing of an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument or anſwer, there falleth in ſome fine ironie, or cloſe quib by alluſion, &amp; ſometime a bitter ſarcaſme, before they be aware: which whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is red of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe part, it raiſeth many hott humors &amp; vnſeemly retaliatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s; which not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hinder the light, ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>times of a good cauſe; but alſo maketh ſuch a breach as will hardlie bee repaired againe in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie yeares.

Therefore the Apoſtle is bold to ſay in the like caſe: <hi>I knowe that this ſhall turne to my ſaluation.</hi> And againe: <hi>We know that all things worke together for the beſt vnto them, that loue God.</hi> The conſideration of this might teach ſome men, to looke vpon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and watch ouer their owne cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, to keepe it vnder, that they

We haue, in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of all men that know and heare vs, prayſed God and prayed for her M. and the ſtate, in regarde of this mercie of God: vve haue in our Sermons &amp; in all our talke (as occaſion is offered) e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer defended the doctrine of faith &amp; of the Sacraments, &amp; the aboliſhing of al hereſie, ſuperſtition and poperie.

If in the ſtile and maner of

Howſoeuer I know the hard purſuite vpon them, and that being (as they verilie thought) further and bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yonde the lawe of this Realm: did giue them great cauſe to bee grieued and offended: that their conſciences ſhould be ſo ſtraightlie preſſed &amp; their labors ſo little regarded, and being Miniſters of the Ghoſpell they ſhoulde bee ſo ſmallie eſteemed: and that the Reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Fathers, accounting thoſe thinges (for which they contend) but meere trifles; would yet preferre them before the miniſtery of ſo many worthy Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, and prouoke their breethren more and further then they need. This doubtleſſe vexed their ſpirit; and ſuch is our weakneſſe and imperfection in this life, that it is an harde thing to keepe meaſure at all times. And when men are perſwaded in conſcienee, that their cauſe is good; their griefe is the

And it were almoſt a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that in ſuch perplexitie, euerie thing ſhould be perfect and without blemiſh.

How can they be our fanſies &amp; proper deuiſes: which were vſed by the Apoſtles ſome a thouſand fiue hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth years before we were borne. And let it be conſidered, whether the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles vſing ſuch thinges haue deſerued to be reproached with our fanſies and proper deuiſes, who are liuing ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie hundred yeares after them, &amp; haue our ſelues learned thoſe thinges out of their holie writings: if this bee well looked into, and aduiſedlie iudged of, by an equall and iuſte line, I hope the ground of this greate and terrible ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation, being voide and emptie, all the other greeuous inferences, will fall and vaniſh away: and that the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie will be euident and apparant to the conſcience of all men.

<pb n="125" facs="tcp:1452:74"/>by no other forme, but that of the booke of common prayer, and that in our publike preaching &amp; pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate talke, in all accaſions wee doe praiſe God &amp; acknowledge his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie &amp; pray for the continuance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and ſtirre vp others ſo to doe: and therevpon doe humbly preſent to the reuerend Fathers &amp; the whole ſtate, verie good &amp; waightie points agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to holy Scripture, needfull to bee conſidered, for the further perfection of our Church and the glorie of God: being no fanſies of ours, or deuiſes, but ſuch as the holye Apoſtles did vſe in the firſt and pureſt Churches: wee ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not be ſaid to ſett our ſelues againſt god; frowardly to diſquiet the church; trouble the common wealth; hazarde the whole ſtate of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; reioyce the wicked, or grieue any godly perſon whatſoeuer: but rather to promote the glorye of God; further the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent good, &amp; encreaſe of our Church, to the great benefit, comfort and ioye of Gods people. And I can not thinke ſo vndutifullie of her Maieſtie, or of any other that haue care of gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: that they would be merueilouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie

But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all other Imeruaill how this can be to hazard the whole ſtate of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, except a man would ſay, that to goe about in honeſt ſort, to make per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, that which is verie well and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellentlie begun, is the high way to deſtroy all.</p>
            <p>But it may bee the myſterie of this point of this obiection, is contained in the ſeconde,<note place="margin">The obiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of innouation</note> which is alſo a matter of great conſequence.

<pb n="127" facs="tcp:1452:75"/>it, we verilie thinke, that it is not on our part, or in cauſe ſo heynous as it is made.

Heere ſhall it be ſaide, that this latter was an innouation, or not a per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fecting of that which of a good and honeſt minde was begunne before, but wanted ſome part of Gods order.
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:1452:76"/>So if we craue no alteratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in religion but onelie that the thinges which are (ſtanding as they doe) may be brought to the order of the Apoſtles vſe and to the canon of Gods holye woorde in thoſe circumſtances which remaine yet vnreformed, I hope it will not bee an innouation. <hi>Ioſiah</hi> one of the moſte excellent Kings of <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Hieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi>

Here you ſee are many and great alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, ſuch as I may boldly ſay, there woulde not be ſo great, if wee had all the things wee deſire: and yet it proued to be no daungerous innouation. And is not God as well able to bleſſe vs, if we goe forward in his Goſpell, as hee

Is it more dangerous to adde a little, now reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is ſetled in mens heartes, then it was at the firſt to make an whole in nouation &amp; change of all, when men had little or no taſte of religion? I am perſwaded, that if the ſtreame did not ſo mightilie and violentlie runne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vs, but that our Reuerend Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and others were as willing to come a degree neerer to the Apoſtles vſe:<note place="margin">If things were reformed, the ſhew of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation would be ſmall.</note> that by the very lawes and orders alreadie eſtabliſhed, we might haue the moſt parte brought into good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, as partly may appeare by the 2. &amp; 3. chapters of this booke, partlie by a booke called the Abſtract, and partly by the authoritie which is giuen to Miniſters touching communicants: &amp; diuers other thinges; which I knowe wiſe and godly men would finde out, that in ſhew there would be no great odds, though ſo much were reformed, as might make vp the breach, which is betweene vs, becauſe wee haue not ſought God altogether in perfect or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. If Subſcription were kept within the compaſſe of law according to the meaning of the ſtatute Anno 13. and

Which thing I vvould not haue touched, but that it might appeare, that the obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of innouation is not ſo materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and of ſuch waight, as it ſeemeth. And I am perſvvaded, there be of the Reuerend Fathers and others in this lande (being as notable men as euer vvere in all Europe) that if it vvould pleaſe God to encline our heartes to agree in this point, to take a brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie order for cutting of all contention, and for the more ſtraight curbing of the vndermining enemie: who would and could, by their vviſedome &amp; lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning doe a great deale more excellent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie that vvay, then I poore weake man am able: vvho vvell knowing mine owne vvantes and imperfection, can

            <p>In the next place it is to be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, vvhether that becauſe the thinges in controuerſie are called external, we may be called ſchiſmaticks. Saint Paul (mee thinketh) doeth helpe vs in this caſe, vvhere hee ſaith:<note place="margin">Rom, 16.17.</note>

For firſt touching the doctrine of the Church of Englande, wee holde it ſtedfaſtly and haue willingly offered to ſubſcribe to the ſame according to the ſtatute, for that cauſe prouided: pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing God hartelie that the true faith by which men may be ſaued, and the true doctrine of the Sacraments, and of the pure worſhipe of God, is trulie taught, and that by publike authoritie, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the booke of articles: ſo that we can not be blamed concerning that booke. Secondly we doe not diſallow the booke of common praier, but doe vſe it &amp; non other in our miniſtrie: but if further then the ſtatute layeth vpon vs for that booke, wee be required to ſubſcribe; and we pray that our doubts might be firſt anſwered in ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culers: we doe no thing againſt the law of the Realm nor againſt the ſaid book eſpeciallie ſeeing that they the ſaide law &amp; book (ſo farre as we can learne) doe not require our ſubſcription to the ſame. Thirdlie for the booke of orders, wee enioye our miniſtrie by the ſame
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:1452:79"/>booke, &amp; doe allow the preaching Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrie ordained by the ſame: but if with out law, we be required to ſubſcribe, and that thereby ſome things be found queſtionable and doubtfull: let all men iudge, whether wee which medled not with that booke or anye of the other bookes, to bewray or vtter any thing againſt any of the ſaid bookes, or they which by a forced ſubſcription con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine vs there vnto: be moſt worthie of blame. Therefore ſeeing we are not againſt any of the ſaid books, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend well of the doctrine, miniſtrie &amp; liturgie, &amp; in not ſubſcribing haue only laboured to keepe a good conſcience without any purpoſe to depraue any of the ſaide bookes; I hope this obiection will returne emptie and without vſe. The ſecond obiection in this rancke is: That ſeeking to erect diſcipline we a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge her Maieſties authoritie:<note place="margin">Secondly touching he authoritie &amp; prerogatiue.</note> by El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, we diminiſh her royall preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue: &amp; by our Paſtour and equaliſing Miniſters, we ſet vp a Pope in euerye Pariſh.

And ſuch is alſo the 37 article of the booke of articles.

Firſt I will prooue not in our doctrine,<note place="margin">We hold all the doctrine of faith with the Church of England: the Papiſtes deny it.</note> &amp; that by two arguments the former is this: we hold, beleeue and teache all the articles of the Chriſtian faith according to the holy Scriptures, euen as the Church of Englande doth; a thing ſo apparant as the Sun at noon daies. And the Papiſtes are heerein di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly contrarie, to the faith and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Church of Englande &amp; to the word of God approouing the ſame. Therefore if ſound doctrine and faith, be the chief mark to know a good man and that the doctrine and faith of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland be good &amp; true: and that the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the papiſts, be nought, wicked and abhominable: then are vve, vvho follovv the good and true doctrine of the Church of England, not to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to the Papiſtes in euill, vvho are
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:1452:85"/>deadly enemies to the ſame. Secondlie that part of doctrine, vvherein we ſeem to differ from the reuerend Fathers of our Church: being ſuch (as is before declared) as agreeth to the principall Canon of our Church in generall, &amp; in particulars vvith the vſage of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and vvith the lawes, iniunctions, Canons, and apologeticall vvritinges of our Church: againſt all vvhich, the Papiſtes moſt conſtantly doe warre &amp; cauill: therefore in this alſo vve be not to be compared vnto them. My latter argument touching our doctrine,<note place="margin">We holde the Queenes ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacie &amp; the Papiſtes deny it.</note> is concerning the ciuill Magiſtrate. We the Miniſters a foreſaid, deſiring the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſhing of all Popiſh remnants, doe hold, beleeue &amp; confeſſe, that all obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience is to bee performed to the ciuill Magiſtrate although they vvere euill and infidels, as the Scripture teacheth. And that no Biſhop,<note place="margin">Rom. 13.1. 1. Pet. 2.13.</note> Prieſt or Miniſter can depriue a King or diſcharge the ſubiects of the oath of allegeance. And that our Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> (God bleſſe her) is ſupreame gouernour ouer all perſons, borne in her dominions, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they bee Eccleſiaſticall or ciuill; &amp; that no forren Potentate, as namelye

And diuers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtatutes there be, as the act for ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillerie &amp; matters of great importance, that might touch men of good place, if they were preſſed vpon as we Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters be: yet they are not at all reputed for euill ſubiectes. What ſhould be the reaſon then, that ſeeing we breake not the law in any poynt domegable, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the Church or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth, we ſhuld be ſo heynouſlie proſecuted
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:1452:94"/>and impeached,<note place="margin">we breake the lawe in no point hurtfull to Church or common wealth.</note> as rebelles and troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of the ſtate, more then other men? What good can the ſurplice, the croſſe in baptiſme, the reading of erroneous bookes, the giuing of ſymbolicall ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification to Matrimonie or confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, or anye ſuch like, doe to the Church or common vvealth? or vvhat harme if they were taken away? ſurelie none at all; But cleane contrarye. For the nearer we approach in our actions, to the rule of holy Scripture, the more vve pleaſe God: &amp; the further vve de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from euill or the appearance of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, the more bleſſed is our eſtate vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the promiſed, &amp; aſſured fauour &amp; grace of almightie God. Therefore for as much as we breake the law, onely in that which can doe no good, but hurt to the Church or common wealth, if we doe them: which if they were altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> away, would be more accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to God, and ſo more likelie of a further encreaſe of Gods mercies (for being contrariant to Gods word, they muſt needs offend God, &amp; hinder ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie good things from vs) we can not be rightlye deemed euill citizens for not doeing of them. And ſeeing it is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:1452:95"/>that theſe things are an offence (&amp; that iuſtlie) to manye of her Ma. good,<note place="margin">To diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage wiſe &amp; faithfull ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes, dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore good to take away the offence.</note> wiſe and faithfull ſubiects; and that it is verie hurtfull, to diſcontent &amp; diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage the good and godly citizens: and that in long experience theſe thinges haue beene a great block of ſtumbling &amp; matter of offence, how much would it bee beneficiall to the whole ſtate, if they wer remoued, and Gods faithfull ſeruants, ſet at libertie from them? For we haue had ſufficient proofe from the firſt ſhining &amp; appearing of the Gho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel in King <hi>Edwards</hi> dayes in this land; Queene <hi>Maries</hi> dayes in Franckford: &amp; now in her M. raigne theſe 43. yeares, that the offence of theſe things by tract of time can not be blotted out: &amp; that thereby manie a worthie preacher, hath beene impriſoned, ſilenſed &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued, to the greate diſhonour of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God, (whoſe ſeruants they were) and to the great damage of the Church and common wealth; which in this greate ſcarſitie of good and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Miniſters, did much want their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice: &amp; therefore it muſt needs follow, that it would haue bene great benefite both to the Church &amp; common wealth
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:1452:95"/>if their petitions had bene hard and a remedie prouided, that ſuch ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie ſeruice had not bene withhol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den &amp; kept back by theſe vnneceſſarie ceremonies.</p>

Experience ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that neither learning nor religion is of ſuch eſtimatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as otherwiſe doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it would haue bene, if theſe occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of euill had not bene maintained. Alſo it is well knowne, that where ſuch Miniſters haue or doe dwell, how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thouſands of people, haue bene in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed and made verie faithfull ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes in their heartes and conſcience: what might this haue wrought, if by the troubles about ceremonies, ſuch fruitfull teachers had not bene remoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, diſcouraged &amp; diſgraced. Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, doubtleſſe; there could not poſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie haue bene ſo great encreaſe of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtes nor anie ſhew of that brauerie, which now they are growne vnto: if the happie courſe of diligent preaching
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:1452:96"/>and teaching, had not beene greatlie ſtopped by troubling of theſe men. For this I can avow, that no Papiſt, Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt, or wicked man, hath any ioy, to liue where there is a good teacher: but that eather they are brought home by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, &amp; become notable Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, or els they ſhifte from ſuch places as men with ſoare eies doe fly the light of the bright ſhining ſunne. For if in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie pariſh there were a faithful prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, teaching both publikelie the true iuſtifying faith of Chriſt, &amp; repentance towards God: and alſo did euer and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non make plaine demonſtration of the Queenes Maieſties lawfull authoritie, and of the Popes moſt wicked and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hominable vſurpatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, without all que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the chiefeſt enemies to our peace, and to her Maieſties ſafetie, would bee ſo diminiſhed, diſperſed &amp; put downe, that wee coulde not heare of ſo many practiſes and wicked treacheries as we doe: and in euerie corner the people woulde cry out vpon them,<note place="margin">Miniſters ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for doing good.</note> bewray them, and ſcorne them. And this is the cauſe that the Papiſtes &amp; Popiſh abe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toures, doe make ſo many grieuous ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations againſt vs, and procure ſo
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:1452:96"/>many troublers; &amp; all vnder colour of fauouring the Queenes proceedinges (whith they hate) that ſo the faith of Chriſt being but little hard of, and her Maieſties ſupremacie but little ſpoken of: both the glorie of Chriſt, and our Queenes honour might bee forgotten: and the deuill and Antichriſt, ſteale in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hartes of her M. poore ſeduced people. I woulde it were conſidered, how little her Maieſties authoritie and the iuſtification of Chriſt, by a greate many hath bene taught theſe 17. or 18. yeares. Therefore by iuſt &amp; plaine ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience I may boldlie ſay, that great benefit to the common wealth, &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie good things for her Maieſties ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, would come to pas by fauour ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vnto theſe godly teachers, &amp; faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Miniſtere of Ieſus Chriſt. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe perauenture ſome will ſay, that heerein I proudlie praiſe our ſelues &amp; like Phariſes deſpiſe others; I doe heere humblie deſire that all men would but indifferently way; What hath ben our doeings, and the labours of our mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrie and the fruite of the ſame: and (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeming vs as baſelie as they can) doe only ſet before their eyes Gods glorie,

In the firſt kinde we are to conſider, whether the religion of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perie, bee within the compaſſe of thoſe
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:1452:97"/>things which God hateth. I finde in I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſraell two kinds of idolatrie: one in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habs</hi> time, <hi>the worſhppping of Baall.</hi>

               <note place="margin">1. King. 123</note> wherefore he is ſaid to make Iſraell to ſinne, this was the making of images to worſhipe God by, as the two calues in <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethell,</hi>
               <note place="margin">28</note> and this beateth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſecond commaundement, which ſaieth: thou ſhalt not make to thy ſelf any grauen images. Of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer kinde I woulde willinglie free the Papiſtes if they would not honour the Pope as God; to binde where God o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth, &amp; to open where God ſhuteth,<note place="margin">The Papiſta moſt groſſe idolaters.</note> giuing power to forgiue ſins &amp; to giue diſpenſation contrarie to Gods worde, dwelling in their hartes as if hee were God: if they did not worſhippe the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament as verie God; and make the image of the Trinitie, turning the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the incorruptible God into the image of a corruptible man: &amp; if they did not aſcribe to the Virgin Marie, to Peter &amp; Paule that which is proper to God alone. But the latter kind is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

If God ſet ſuch a marke vpon <hi>Hieroboam,</hi> that hee did not only vtterly roote out his ſeed; but alſo made his name a reproach to all generations, as the author of Iſraels ſinn.

Moreouer it will bring great occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ciuill warre and bloodſhed (a thing which her M. alwaies abhorred) which being once kindled &amp; inflamed: it will trouble the wiſeſt men in this Realme to quench ſuddainlie or ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtelie. For it is well knowne, that there is an inueterate hatred betweene theſe two religions, and the oppoſition is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſsible to bee reconciled. How theſe two may dwell together in peace, let them iudge that dare put an adder in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their boſomes, and pull not out the ſtinge, or that will place foxes among the tender vines, or woolues among ſheepe. Yf you bid me caſt mine eies v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon Fraunce and the low Countries,<note place="margin">Miſerable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience in Fraunce.</note> I anſwer: that miſerable experience ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth in France, ſufficient to terrifie vs from this counſell. How many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands haue periſhed by the ſweard, &amp; by all kind of beaſtly butcherie, before they coulde haue any quiet, it woulde make a mans hart to bleede to read or to thinke. And if the verie we arines of ciuill warre, &amp; ſpilling of mans blood, and the feare of rooting out their nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the ſpeciall prouidence of God, for the caſe of his Church, had not
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:1452:99"/>wrought contrarie to reaſon and the nature of thinges, it could not haue ſo fallen out. And how long it will hold, no man can promiſe. But if God haue conſtrained the idolater to tolerate his Ghoſpell: ſhall that bee a preſident to the worſhipper of God, to wincke at idolatrie, contrarie to his expres com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement. In the low Countries at the verie firſt, diuers cieties for their ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fetie (as namely <hi>Antwerpe,</hi>)<note place="margin">Hiſt. Belgic. A.E.

And being their quarrell of their priuiledges and liberties, and thereby many Papiſtes ioyning in the quarrell with them, they could not wade ſo fare as otherwiſe they woulde, till God by the preaching hath brought them to be of one religion and ſetled: as I haue ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie credible report, that all places vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the States are at this time of one profeſſed religion: But now our ſtate in England hath continued in one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion (God bee therefore highlie prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed) full three &amp; fortie yeares.<note place="margin">Our ſtate hath bene long ſetled in one religion.</note> It would make a ſhrewde breach to tolerate a thing after ſo long time: when ſo many
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:1452:100"/>thouſands be growne vp to be men of yeares, nouriſhed in all their life long in one religion: it will bee daintie for them, to ſee the glorye of God diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured dailie before their eies. Yea I verilie thinke that many rude and idle fellowes, which neuer feared God, or cared for religion, wil be greedie to ſee ſuch a new thing, and finding it to bee ſuch apretie pageant, fit for reaſonable men to laugh and to make a game of, they will doubtleſſe bee playing with them: and theſe zealous and ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous idolaters can abide no diſgrace, to their holie miſhapen fooleries: And what will followe, euerie ſimple man may eaſily gueſſe. But imagine it were poſsible for men becauſe of quietneſſe to winck at it a while. Mark then what muſt needes bee the fruite and effect thereof: Namelie that the Seminarie and ſecular Prieſtes,<note place="margin">The fruite of tolerating poperie.</note> with their fained enemies the Ieſuites (being quicklie reconciled) attending buſelie vppon their harueſt, will ſpeedelie ſounde out the depth of their ſtrength, augment it and combine it moſt ſurelie. And when they haue fitted their longed prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſafelie contriued their ſacred
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:1452:100"/>coniuration: they will eftſoones open the porte to their roaring bull, and on a ſuddaine ſurpriſe boeth Prince and people, and turne all vp ſide downe. And then tell mee (by the example of the <hi>Guiſes</hi> in Fraunce, taking into their power the Queene Mother and her ſonne,) what may be our hope, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther how many vnfpeakeable euills &amp; calamities, are like to ſwallow vp the peace, wealth &amp; ioy of our land: which by &amp; with the Ghoſpell, we haue thus manie yeares enioyed, vnder her Ma. moſt happie and godly preſent gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nement. But now perhappes (as they ſay) they haue learned by long experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, to reurence her Maieſtie: and that it is not their way by treaſon and rebellion, by murder &amp; inuaſion, now they will be louing, peaceable &amp; faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, if they be tolerated. Surely,<note place="margin">No truſt in Papiſtes.</note> ſurely who ſeeth not? that if hauing ſo manie lawes againſt them, they haue labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſo diligentlye to ſet vp the Popes kingdome: much more vvill they doe it if they haue libertie: and if vvhen all places vvatch ouer them, they dare venture as they haue done; much more

But in the book of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon prayer this is deſtroyed, for there is prouided exhortations, ſentences of Scripture and homilies to be red vpon all occaſions: ſo that hee neede not preach except hee coulde or woulde. Therefore I can not ſee, but that this ſubſcription, as it is vrged by the reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Fathers in the two laſt articles, is ſinne, and a great offence to God. For which cauſe I quake and tremble as oft as I think vpon it, that ſo many worthy Paſtours as are in our Church, can not enter to ſerue in Gods houſe, but by doing ſo fearfull a ſinne. Moſt humblie entreating the reuerend Fathers of our Church, to conſider wiſelie and in the
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:1452:112"/>feare of God, what euill they bring v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon this land and the Church. If they haue not compaſsion vpon their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, but ſuffer the holie ones of God, which come neere vnto him, ſo greatly to ſinne. Now whether this be not one of the troublers of the ſtate, &amp; a great offence to God, to prouoke him, to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer downe his plagues vpon vs, I refer it to the conſcience of all men; which can &amp; doe looke into this cauſe with a ſingle eye.</p>
            <p>Nowe theſe three troublers of the ſtate,<note place="margin">A ring of three ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the ſtate.</note> are like a band of men, caſt into a ring. The firſt making way for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond; the ſecond ſupplying the firſt, and the laſt, ſupporting them both. For the vnpreaching miniſtrie giueth occaſion, that the learned men ſhould haue the greater promotions and preferment, that they might preach, here and there as they ſee cauſe, where there is neede, and the non-reſident is willing or dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to haue ſuch an vnpreaching Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter vnder him, that he may liue as he liſt: Subſcription warranteth them both becauſe they are conformable to the law and order. The vnpreaching Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter giueth honour to the non-reſident
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:1452:112"/>calling him a good gentilman &amp; a lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned diuine; and the non-reſident doth giue credite to the other, ſaying, hee is a verie honeſt quiet man, liuing order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie with his neighbours. And ſubſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on doth ratifie their ſayings by keeping out, many painfull and learned men, which preach againſt them both. The vnpreaching Miniſter reioyceth bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the learned non-reſident, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countes of him as worthie of the holie miniſtrie, though hee be ſimple &amp; haue no learning: the non-reſident is made the more worſhipfull; when hee can haue ſuch to ſerue him, &amp; croutch vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him: and ſubſcription making all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men diſobedient and troublers of the ſtate and ſuch, as the Church hath neede of (which if they could come in without ſubſcription, woulde bee dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent to feede Gods flock) doth comfort them both, as honeſt men, orderly and peceably, and louers of the ſtate, while theſe three doe take hands &amp; are linc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked one with in another, they are a threefold cord which can not bee bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken: And hauing alway a fayre ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning reflex one vpon the other, their eyes are dazeled that they ſee no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:1452:113"/>and ſo they doe not perceaue that, <hi>they meaſure them ſelues with them ſelues,</hi>

            <p>The ſtring which holdeth vp the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preaching miniſtrie is;<note place="margin">The ſtringe whereon the vnpreaching miniſter doth hang.</note> that hee is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that God requireth of him no more then he is able: and hee thinketh the reuerend Fathers would not ſuffer him, if this ſtanding were ſinne. And therefore it is nowe come to this paſſe, that if ſome men finde fault with their courſe, they are ſaid to bring the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrie into contempt, which ought not to be ſuffered, So is the poore man bol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtered in his ſinne, and the Church is damnified for lack of a good teacher. To whome in the feare of God &amp; loue I haue to his ſoule, I anſwer thus. Firſt that he is to conſider, whether God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth anie man to enter into the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrie, that is vnable to preach which if it be not to be found (as verilie it can not be, as I haue ſhewed before) then is it ſinne for him to enter in, and it is the heaping vp of ſin to continue (for liuing ſake) in that calling. God hath

Thirdlie: ſo they preach, they are not to be char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, although they preach not in their owne Pariſh. For the firſt, I would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire them to remember, howe they bee rewardes of learning: namelie either, becauſe men haue learning;<note place="margin">1.

<pb n="205" facs="tcp:1452:115"/>haue ſuch rewardes? Euen ſo I muſt needes highlie commend her Maieſtie and the ſtate, for the good and lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble prouiſion, which is for the miniſtrie of this land, being ſuch as if it were well vſed of vs, it might be greatlie to the glorie of God, and the enlargement and honour of his Church: yet I cannot think ſo meanlie of her Maieſties prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celie diſcretion, or of the wiſe care of the ſtate: that they would cauſe or ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, the people of the lande, to pay the tenth part of their profites or rentes; to mayntaine a companie of idle men in their ſilkes and veluetts, &amp; to fare deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſlie: and not to take paines by their learning to edifye Gods people; of whome they haue ſo greate liuing for that purpoſe.

One would not think it ſo: ſeeing they haue the holy Scriptures red in a know en tongue, and now and then ſermons quarterlie, yet ſurelie it is true in verie many places. For I haue bene in a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh of foure hundred communicants, and marueiling that my preaching was ſo little regarded, I tooke vpon me to conferre with euerie man and woman, before they receaued the communion. And I asked them of Chriſt, what hee was in his perſon: what his office: howe ſinne came into the worlde: what pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment for ſinne: what becomes of our bodies being rotten in the graues: and laſtly, whether it were poſsible for a man to liue ſo vprightlie, that by well doeing he might winne heauen. In all the former queſtions, I skarſe founde
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:1452:119"/>tenne in the hundred, to haue anie knowledge, but in the laſt queſtion skarſe one, but did affirme, that a man might be ſaued by his owne weldoing: and that he truſted he did ſo liue, that by Gods grace, hee ſhoulde obtaine e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting life by ſeruing of God and good prayers, &amp;c. Where I am, I haue bene twelue yeares, I haue euery yeare communed with ſuch ſtrangers as haue come into this Pariſh, either houſ-kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers or ſeruants; and being ſmall, there comes ſome yeare not paſsing ſix, ſome tenne, &amp; ſome yeres more. And truly God is my witnes, that I lie not, I haue found ſome that haue comd from Pariſhes, where there hath bene dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent teaching, to anſwere mee verye handſomlie, in all theſe thinges: but I can hardly remember any one, which had continued vnder a Non-reſident and vnpreaching miniſtrie, that had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny knowledge, eſpeciallie to tell vvhat Chriſt is, or that wee are ſaued by faith in him, and not by works. Therefore I haue asked the like of others, vvhich haue tooke the ſame paines as I did, and they haue affirmed to me the very ſame. Novv then, this being ſo, tell me
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:1452:120"/>I pray you: Firſt for Atheiſme, whether theſe be any better then Atheiſts which know not Chriſt.

If God ſhutt the heauens, that there be no raine, men can quickly eſpie that there is a plague. So is it great pittie that men ſee not, that in regard of our ſoules, the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrie is as neceſſarie as the raine: and therefore when the ſame is hindered or taken away, it is a verie great and damnable puniſhment. In ſo much as the holy ſpirit of God, calleth it by the name of a famine.

Who knoweth not how much blood of Gods Saintes was ſpilte in former ages, and how many houſes were guilty of blood. And when did this land ſeriouſlie and ſincerelie humble it ſelfe, and by open repentance make reconciliation for the ſame? Nay rather, how many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſandes repined at the happie raigne of her Maieſtie for the caſting out of the idolatrous and ſuperſtitious worſhipp of God, and for the eſtabliſhing of the true ſeruice of his holy name, and the libertie of the preaching of the Gho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell?

And had not God of a ſingular mercie, taken away ſome perſones, in the ruffe of their pride; and had not her Maieſtie by the ſpeciall bleſsing of God, with a moſt wiſe and religious care, moderate the extreemitie: I can not tell, how manie of vs, by this time, had loſt our liues, in giuing teſtimonie to the gouernement and Kingdome of Chriſt: as our breethren in tymes paſt did vnto his ſacrifice and Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</p>

<pb n="222" facs="tcp:1452:131"/>haue counted them ſelues happie, if they coulde haue come neere vnto it. And the ſtate being ſetled, they might thinke it was wiſdome and behoofull to maintaine all, leaſt they ſhoulde of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fende her Maieſtie and the ſtate: and iudge it better to leeſe ſome few Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, then to fall into greater inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencie. And being them ſelues per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that there was no impious thing, they might ſuppoſe it their duty and a godlie policie, by Subſcription to bring all men to conformity. And when they had ſome hard and bitter wordes in the admonitions, they might deeme the Miniſters not ſo wiſe, nor ſo godly, as they pretended: and hauing beene enueighed by continuall complaintes, and ſuggeſtions of wicked Papiſts and Atheiſtes, they might conceaue an ill opinion of their breethren, and ſo bee foreſtalled in iudgement. And laſtlie, being prouoked by wicked <hi>Martin,</hi> they might conclude their cauſe to be abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutelie good, for ſo much as they were perſued by vnlawfull &amp; wicked means and ſo by a verie ſtronge ſeeming co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of God, they might eaſilie fall into a ſelfe weening, and deſpiſe their good
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:1452:131"/>and godlie brethren. So on the other ſide the godlie Miniſters, no doubt ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the teſtimony of their conſcience, that the thinges they ſtoode againſt, were worthie to be reformed: and that for no other cauſe but meere conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, they refuſed to obſerue the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies: &amp; when they had diuers yeares kept themſelues cloſe &amp; ſile<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing regarded, nor pittied, but preſſed ſo earneſtly to ſubſcribe &amp; allow againſt Gods word, all maner of things, and as they thought a great deale more then the law did require. Then to bee ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended, depriued, impriſoned, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers waies in tearmes moſt vncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie prouoked, they might geſſe that theſe reuerend Fathers were not Gods Biſhops, and in their anger they might ſuppoſe it lawfull, to entertaine them with ſuch ſharpe and bitter tearmes, as in the admonitions &amp; other writtinges perauenture is to bee founde. And as concerning <hi>Martin,</hi> it may be at the firſt they were amaſed, to thinke what it ſhould meane, that God had ſtirred vp ſuch a thinge to diſgrace them which ſtood againſt the good proceedings of the Ghoſpell, &amp; the kingdome of Chriſt
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:1452:132"/>they could not tell whether it were in their part to medle in that matter; and ſeeing and feeling the hotte purſuite of that time, to ly heauie vpon them, they might eaſilie forgett ſomething, that had beene neceſſarie for them to haue preuented. And for them both, I hope, I may trulie ſay, that if there were not ſome ſecret matter (which God know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and not I) if there were ſome man of authoritie and reuerence,<note place="margin">The Biſhopps and Miniſters may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled.</note> who could lay his hande vpon them both, they might verie well bee reconciled. For both the reuerende Fathers for their part, haue and doe beare with many of the godlie Miniſters, and the Miniſters for their parts doe vſe all reuerence &amp; good cariage toward them. Onelie the cauſe of ceremonies and diſcipline is reſerued on both ſides, and ſtandeth vnder further tryall. Therefore in my iudgement, the whole and principall fault is not to be laide vpon the one or the other: but that if the people of this lande, who by this meanes were verie greatlie puniſhed, haue humbled them ſelues to God by praier, faſting, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendement of life, and thankfully em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced, and carefully practiſed the holy
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:1452:132"/>Ghoſpell: no doubt God would ſoone haue eaſed all this griefe, and quicklie found out a ſweet remedy of brotherly reconciliation.</p>
            <p>But if I may ſpeak according to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Scripture, I thinke it an exceeding mercie of God, that he hath ſuffered vs to haue ſo many good Preachers and ſo many daies of the Ghoſpell, as wee haue. For if we looke vpon the people, wee ſhall ſee the grounde of all theſe thinges. How little haue they eſteemed the godlie and learned Miniſters! How content they be with ſimple and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant men! How hardly are they drawn to pay duties, which law hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. How many quarrells they pick a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt painful Miniſters: and how little reuerence they giue to any that are faithfull! How they follow their coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſnes and pleaſures! How they fil all ſortes of Courtes with brawles, fooliſh and wilfull ſtrifes and ſutes &amp; demures in law, with murders, whoordomes, dronkennes, &amp; all diſorder. For braue buildinges, coſtlie apparell, and dainty dyet, they haue great plentie: but eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie little thing which is beſtowed vpon the Church, is thought to much: nay, I
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:1452:133"/>woulde they did not vſe deuiſes, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh the liuinges of the Church, and to oppreſſe poore men, when they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into their charges. If the Lord ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing placed his worde among vs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding their little thankfulnes to him ſelfe, and greate vnkindnes to his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantes. If hee looking for fruite at their hands, find nothing but a leaper ſoare. If he finde that they bee in friendſhipe with Papiſtes and Atheiſtes for world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wealth: and giue more countenance to dronkards and whoormaiſters, then to the frithfull Miniſters of Chriſt: what man iudgeing with a ſpirituall eie ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the holy Scripture, can o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe deeme, but that God hath laid theſe thinges iuſtlye vpon vs for our ſinnes, and for the vngratefulnes of the people. So that I may boldly ſay, that although wee haue ſeene great tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and God hath outwardlie ſhaken his rod, in the heauens by blaſing ſtars and tempeſtes, windes and vnſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble weather; in the earth by earthquaks and greate dearth; in our bodies with peſtilence and manie ſtrange ſickneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. And beſide all this the enemies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broade hath offered to inuade vs. We

May wee not looke euerie daye to haue it worſe, if we continue thus in our wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe, without true repentance? O that it woulde pleaſe God, to open our eies, that euen now at the length, euen in this day, we could know the things, which belong vnto our peace!<note place="margin">A prayer for concord and confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie to the Ghoſpell.</note> Seeing then wee are thus wrapped and intan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled in the nett of Gods heauie iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, I doe therefore humblie praye and deſire hartely almightie God, that hee woulde conuert vs vnto him ſelfe boeth Miniſters &amp; people: and that we the Miniſters of the word, would ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſlie remember that we are brethren:
